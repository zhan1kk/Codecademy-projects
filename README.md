# Codecademy-projects
## Couple of small projects I did while taking a course "Data Science: Machine Learning" in Codecademy.
This repository includes 4 projects, the most interesting ones, personally for me, are handling missing data and coded-correspondence. 

### Download insructions
You can simply download the files/folders and then open them using any tool like Pycharm. Only for "handling missing data" you will need to download the dataset separately from the link and add the file to your folder with .ipynb files. The link to download it is located on the top part of project_handling_missing_data.ipynb. 

### Brief overview of the projects
**Handling missing data**
This project's purpose is to implement different ways of handling missing data based on its type such as MAR, MCAR. I used a dataset from Kaggle which consists of survey responses by developers all over the world for the last few years. 
*Libraries used:* pandas, seaborn, numPy, IterativeImputer from sklearn. 
*Solutions/analysis implemented:* Exploratory Data Analysis, Pairwise Deletion, Single Imputation (NOCB), Multiple Imputation 

**Coded correspondence**
Small interesting project on topic of ciphers. I created functions for decoding and encoding messages for Caesar and Vigenere ciphers. 

**Hurricane analysis**
Very simple task where I manipulated data to analyse patterns in the data

**Medical Insurance**
Also a simple task of analysing small dataset to find the correlation between data factors
